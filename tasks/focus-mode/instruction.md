# Focus Mode

Build a simple mixed-reality tool with three movable opaque virtual screens. Implement it in the supplied application scaffold at `/workspace/app`.

## Description

Focus Mode provides three plain opaque screens that the user can arrange around the room. The screens are independent movable panels with no puzzle, scoring, or required layout.

## User experience

- The app presents exactly three simple rectangular screens at comfortable initial positions.
- Every screen is fully opaque. Do not use translucent, transparent, cutout, or passthrough areas inside a screen.
- The user selects any screen with the controller ray and moves it freely through the nearby workspace.
- Releasing selection leaves the screen at its current position and orientation.
- There are no required positions, placement rules, score, or completion state.

## Project layout

- Build the application only in `/workspace/app`. Do not modify, replace, or
  vendor `/workspace/xrblocks`; it is the pinned, read-only XR Blocks SDK.
- Use the supplied static app scaffold and local dependencies. Do not install,
  reinstall, or vendor dependencies unless this task explicitly requires a
  dependency change.

## Tagging the app

Attach a stable tag only to each listed user-facing control, interaction target,
or durable visible result: `object.userData.xrblocksDevtools = { tag: "..." }`.
Tags identify scene objects; they do not replace visible behavior.

Each listed tag identifies exactly one live object unless its entry explicitly
allows multiple objects. Attach the tag to the semantic owner of the control,
target, or result. Do not also attach that tag to a helper mesh or to an
ancestor or descendant of the semantic owner.

- `focus-screen`: each movable opaque screen. Multiple objects can use this tag.

## Provided workspace and resources

- `/workspace/app` contains the static starter application. Its `index.html`
  and `main.js` are the application source. Run `npm run dev` from that directory
  for a development preview. DevTools serves the files directly during
  verification; no app build step is required.
- `/workspace/xrblocks` contains the buildable XR Blocks source tree, public
  documentation, samples, templates, skills, and local assets. Treat it as
  read-only reference material.
- Center your implementation on XR Blocks conventions. Learn more about XR
  Blocks in `/workspace/xrblocks/docs` and `/workspace/xrblocks/skills`.
- `xrblocks-devtools` is installed on `PATH` and includes the browser-based XR
  simulator and inspection tools. Run `xrblocks-devtools --help` to list its public
  commands. Do not modify the internal source code.
- Dependencies and XR Blocks assets are already available locally. Network
  access can be restricted; use supplied local resources.
